# Minescript
Fork of [XAHK](https://github.com/monpjc/XAHK), an Auto Key Clicker for Minecraft under request from [Xisumavoid](https://www.youtube.com/c/XisumavoidMC) that allows you to use your computer at the same time. Developed for use with vanilla Minecraft and works with all versions.

## Features
Allows running the Minecraft game client and interacting with the world while the user is away from their computer. Minescript will send a stream of keyboard and mouse inputs to a target game window as if the user was playing the game. It features many different modes of AFK farming, including:
- AFK Fishing
- AFK Concrete Convertion
- AFK Mob Grinding

The biggest feature is that you can use other apps on your comptuer while Minescript is running, all thanks to the power of AHK!

## Installation and Usage
1. Download and Install AutoHotkey from their [official website](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
2. Download the latest release of the Minescript executable form the [releases page](https://github.com/histefanhere/minescript/releases)
3. Run the executable and follow the on-screen instructions; the [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/-wKW0OovGK4?t=280) by [xisumavoid](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU9pX8hKcrx06XfOB-VQLdw) also contains some additional instructions.


## YouTube Video
Xisumavoid made a video about a (now outdated) fish farm design, and featured the original auto clicker in the video:

## Platform Support
Although Minecraft runs on multiple platforms, this software requires AutoHotkey which supports *Windows only*.

Linux players may find an alternative by using a [shell script](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/bu4gka/linux_autoclicker_bash_script_useful_for_afk/).

Mac players can use MacOS's built-in accessibiltiy features and a full-size keyboard with a numeric keypad:
1. Open System Preferences
2. Go to Accessibility → Pointer Control → Alternate Control Methods and enable "Mouse Keys"
3. In Minecraft, position your avatar for the activity (fishing, for example) and press ⌃5️⃣  (control+5, on the numpad) to send a "right click"
4. Now tap 0️⃣  (on the numpad) to simulate "hold right click"; note that you cannot switch applications as with Minescript
